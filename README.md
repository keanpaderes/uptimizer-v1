# Uptimizer V1

This project is an ultimate optimizer and a diet solver application made as a requirement for CMSC 150 Numeric and Symbolic computation. The ultimate optimizer uses Simplex to maximize or minimize objetive functions given a constraint. In-app instructions are available to guide users. This project uses the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project skeleton.

## Installation

To get you started you can simply clone this repository or unzip the source code file.

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the angular-seed repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone uptimizer-v1

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][https://github.com/keanpaderes/uptimizer-v1.git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/keanpaderes/uptimizer-v1.git
cd uptimizer-v1
```

### Install Dependencies

Install both npm and bower, these are the dependencies of the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

To configure the dependencies, just run:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

To start the program, just run:

```
npm start
